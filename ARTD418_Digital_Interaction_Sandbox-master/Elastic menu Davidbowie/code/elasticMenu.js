There’s also \na frightening glimpse into future Bowie \nuniverses, served up by We Are Hungry Men, a \ntale of a world in which food is so scarce that \nthe people have resorted to cannibalism. Not \nall of the songs are such sharp observations of \nhuman frailties and failings, while the distinctly \nfamily-entertainment style arrangements make \nit clear that, whatever audience Bowie was \naiming for, rock fans were not included among \nthem. But songs like Love You Till Tuesday and \nMaid of Bond Street have a catchy irresistibility \nto them all the same, and though this material \nhas been repackaged with such mind-numbing \nfrequency as to seem all but irrelevant today, \nDavid Bowie still remains a remarkable piece of \nwork. And it sounds less like anything else he’s \never done than any subsequent record in his \ncatalog.");

His first ever hit \nsingle, the super-topical “Space Oddity,” had \nscored on the back of the moon landing that \nsummer, and so distinctive an air did it \npossess that, for a moment, its maker really \ndid seem capable of soaring as high as Major \nTom. Sadly, it was not to be. “Space Oddity” \naside, Bowie possessed very little in the way \nof commercial songs, and the ensuing album \n(his second) emerged as a dense, even \nrambling, excursion through the folky strains \nthat were the last glimmering of British \npsychedelia. Indeed, the album’s most crucial \ncut, the lengthy “Cygnet Committee,” was \nnothing less than a discourse on the death of \nhippiness, shot through with such bitterness \nand bile that it remains one of Bowie’s all-time \nmost important numbers — not to mention his \nmost prescient. The verse that unknowingly \nname-checks both the Sex Pistols (“the guns \nof love”) and the Damned is nothing if not a \ndistillation of everything that brought punk to \nits knees a full nine years later. The remainder \nof the album struggles to match the sheer \nvivacity of “Cygnet Committee,” although \n“Unwashed and Slightly Dazed” comes close \nto packing a disheveled rock punch, all the \nmore so as it bleeds into a half minute or so of \nBowie wailing “Don’t Sit Down” — an element \nthat, mystifyingly, was hacked from the 1972 \nreissue of the album. “Janine” and “An \nOccasional Dream” are pure ‘60s balladry, \nand “God Knows I’m Good” takes a well-\nmeant but somewhat clumsy stab at social \ncomment. Two final tracks, however, can be \nsaid to pinpoint elements of Bowie’s own \nfuture. The folk epic “Wild Eyed Boy from \nFreecloud” (substantially reworked from the \nB-side of the hit) would remain in Bowie’s live \nset until as late as 1973, while a re-recorded \nversion of the mantric “Memory of a Free \nFestival” would become a single the following \nyear, and marked Bowie’s first studio \ncollaboration with guitarist Mick Ronson. The \nalbum itself however, proved another dead \nend in a career that was gradually piling up an \nawful lot of such things");

Working with guitarist Mick \nRonson and producer Tony Visconti for the \nsecond time Bowie developed a tight, twisted \nheavy guitar rock that appears simple on the \nsurface but sounds more gnarled upon each \nlisten. The mix is off-center, with the fuzz-\nbass dominating the compressed, razor-thin \nguitars and Bowie’s strangled, affected voice. \nThe sound of The Man Who Sold the World is \nodd, but the music itself is bizarre, with \nBowie’s weird, paranoid futuristic tales \nmelded to Ronson’s riffing and the band’s \nrelentless attack. Musically, there isn’t much \ninnovation on The Man Who Sold the World — \nit is almost all hard blues-rock or psychedelic \nfolk-rock — but there’s an unsettling edge to \nthe band’s performance, which makes the \nrecord one of Bowie’s best albums.");

Not \nonly did the album boast more folky songs \n(“Song for Bob Dylan,” “The Bewlay \nBrothers”), but he again flirted with Anthony \nNewley-esque dancehall music (“Kooks,” “Fill \nYour Heart”), seemingly leaving heavy metal \nbehind. As a result, Hunky Dory is a \nkaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied \ntogether only by Bowie’s sense of vision: a \nsweeping, cinematic mélange of high and low \nart, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class. \nMick Ronson’s guitar is pushed to the back, \nleaving Rick Wakeman’s cabaret piano to \ndominate the sound of the album. The \nsubdued support accentuates the depth of \nBowie’s material, whether it’s the revamped \nTin Pan Alley of “Changes,” the Neil Young \nhomage “Quicksand,” the soaring “Life on \nMars?,” the rolling, vaguely homosexual \nanthem “Oh! You Pretty Things,” or the dark \nacoustic rocker “Andy Warhol.” On the \nsurface, such a wide range of styles and \nsounds would make an album incoherent, but \nBowie’s improved songwriting and determined \nsense of style instead made Hunky Dory a \ntouchstone for reinterpreting pop’s traditions \ninto fresh, postmodern pop music.");

Constructed as a loose \nconcept album about an androgynous alien \nrock star named Ziggy Stardust, the story falls \napart quickly, yet Bowie’s fractured, paranoid \nlyrics are evocative of a decadent, decaying \nfuture, and the music echoes an apocalyptic, \nnuclear dread. Fleshing out the off-kilter \nmetallic mix with fatter guitars, genuine pop \nsongs, string sections, keyboards, and a \ncinematic flourish, Ziggy Stardust is a glitzy \narray of riffs, hooks, melodrama, and style and \nthe logical culmination of glam. Mick Ronson \nplays with a maverick flair that invigorates \nrockers like “Suffragette City,” “Moonage \nDaydream,” and “Hang Onto Yourself,” while \n“Lady Stardust,” “Five Years,” and “Rock ’n’ \nRoll Suicide” have a grand sense of staged \ndrama previously unheard of in rock & roll. \nAnd that self-conscious sense of theater is \npart of the reason why Ziggy Stardust sounds n\so foreign. Bowie succeeds not in spite of his \npretensions but because of them, and Ziggy \nStardust — familiar in structure, but alien in \nperformance — is the first time his vision and \nexecution met in such a grand, sweeping \nfashion.");

A lighter affair than Ziggy Stardust, \nAladdin Sane is actually a stranger album than \nits predecessor, buoyed by bizarre lounge-jazz \nflourishes from pianist Mick Garson and a \nhandful of winding, vaguely experimental \nsongs. Bowie abandons his futuristic \nobsessions to concentrate on the detached \ncool of New York and London hipsters, as on \nthe compressed rockers “Watch That Man,” \n“Cracked Actor,” and “The Jean Genie.” Bowie \nfollows the hard stuff with the jazzy, dissonant \nsprawls of “Lady Grinning Soul,” “Aladdin \nSane,” and “Time,” all of which manage to be \nboth campy and avant-garde simultaneously, \nwhile the sweepingly cinematic “Drive-In \nSaturday” is a soaring fusion of sci-fi doo wop \nand melodramatic teenage glam. He lets his \nparanoia slip through in the clenched rhythms \nof “Panic in Detroit,” as well as on his oddly \nclueless cover of “Let’s Spend the Night \nTogether.” For all the pleasures on Aladdin \nSane, there’s no distinctive sound or theme to \nmake the album cohesive; it’s Bowie riding the \nwake of Ziggy Stardust, which means there’s a \nwealth of classic material here, but not \nenough focus to make the album itself a classic.");

Just as a lot of fans \nof Levon Helm et al. couldn’t figure where a \nbunch of rock & roll and R&B covers fit \nalongside their output of original songs, so \nBowie’s fans — after enjoying a string of \nfiercely original LPs going back to 1970’s The \nMan Who Sold the World — weren’t able to \nmake too much out of Pin Ups’ new recordings \nof a brace of ‘60s British hits. Ziggy Stardust \nand Aladdin Sane had established Bowie as \nperhaps the most fiercely original of all \nEngland’s glam rockers (though Marc Bolan’s \nfans would dispute that to their dying day), so \nan album of covers didn’t make any sense and \nwas especially confusing for American fans — \napart from the Easybeats’ “Friday on My \nMind” and the Yardbirds’ “Shapes of Things,” \nlittle here was among the biggest hits of their \nrespective artists’ careers, and the Who’s “I \nCan’t Explain” and “Anyway Anyhow \nAnywhere” were the only ones whose original \nversions were easily available or played very \noften on the radio; everything else was as \nmuch a history lesson, for Pink Floyd fans \nwhose knowledge of that band went back no \nfurther than Atom Heart Mother, or into \nLiverpool rock (the Merseys’ “Sorrow”), as it \nwas a tour through Bowie’s taste in ‘60s \nmusic. The latter was a mixed bag stylistically, \nopening with the Pretty Things’ high-energy \nBo Diddley homage “Rosalyn” and segueing \ndirectly into a hard, surging rendition of \nThem’s version of Bert Berns’ “Here Comes \nthe Night,” filled with crunchy guitars; “I Wish \nYou Would” and “Shapes of Things” were both \nshowcases for Bowie’s and Mick Ronson’s \nguitars, and “See Emily Play” emphasized the \npunkish (as opposed to the psychedelic) side \nof the song. “Sorrow,” which benefited from a \nnew saxophone break, was actually a distinct \nimprovement over the original, managing to \nbe edgier and more elegant all at once, and \ncould easily have been a single at the time, \nand Bowie’s slow version of “I Can’t Explain” \nwas distinctly different from the Who’s original \n— in other words, Pin Ups was an artistic \nstatement, of sorts, with some thought behind \nit, rather than just a quick album of oldies \ncovers to buy some time, as it was often \ndismissed as being. In the broader context of \nBowie’s career, Pin Ups was more than an \nanomaly — it marked the swan song for the \nSpiders from Mars and something of an \ninterlude between the first and second phases\nof his international career; the next, beginning \nwith Diamond Dogs, would be a break from his\nglam rock phase, going off in new directions. \nIt’s not a bad bridge between the two, and it \nhas endured across the decades.");

Originally conceived as \na concept album based on George Orwell’s \n1984, Diamond Dogs evolved into another one \nof Bowie’s paranoid future nightmares. \nThroughout the album, there are hints that \nhe’s tired of the Ziggy formula, particularly in \nthe disco underpinning of “Candidate” and his \ncut-and-paste lyrics. However, it’s not enough \nto make Diamond Dogs a step forward, and \nwithout Mick Ronson to lead the band, the \nrockers are too stiff to make an impact. \nIronically, the one exception is one of Bowie’s \nvery best songs — the tight, sexy “Rebel \nRebel.” The song doesn’t have much to do \nwith the theme, and the ones he does throw in \nto further the story usually fall flat.

Its primary appeal, of course, is \nto Bowie completists, who will gush over the relative \nrarities “Heroes/Helden” (Bowie shifting from English \nto German in mid-song) and a live version of “Station \nto Station,” as well as some magnificently extensive \nliner notes recapping both the film and the songs. \nMore casual yet devoted fans will be disappointed \nby the truncated “TVC-15” and “Stay” (the latter \nexcising nearly all of Earl Slick’s searing guitar \npyrotechnics), but will gain some much-needed \nexposure to Eno’s brand of atmospheric \norchestration. Despite the melancholia of Eno’s \nwordless contributions and the film’s dark theme, \nthere are moments of levity to be found in “TVC-15” \nand “Boys Keep Swinging”; that mix of darks and l\nights makes the soundtrack to Christiane F. — \nwhich, tragically, did not see CD release until 2001 \n— an intriguing listen for anyone who appreciates \nDavid Bowie’s artistic output from the mid- to late ‘70s.");

Let’s Dance comes tearing out of the gate, \npropulsed by the skittering “Modern Love,” the \nseductively menacing “China Girl,” and the brittle \nfunk of the title track. All three songs became \ninternational hits, and for good reason — they’re \ncatchy, accessible pop songs that have just enough \nof an alien edge to make them distinctive. However, \nthat careful balance is quickly thrown off by a \nsuccession of pleasant but unremarkable plastic soul \nworkouts. “Cat People” and a cover of Metro’s \n“Criminal World” are relatively strong songs, but the \nremainder of the album indicates that Bowie was \nentering a songwriting slump. However, the three hits \nwere enough to make the album a massive hit, and \ntheir power hasn’t diminished over the years, even if \nthe rest of the record sounds like an artifact.");

To say as much suggests that it’s \na bit of a lost classic, when it’s rather a sporadically \nintriguing transitional album, finding Bowie balancing \nthe commercial dance-rock of Let’s Dance with artier \ninclinations from his Berlin period, all the while trying \nto draw on the past by working with former Spider \nfrom Mars guitarist Mick Ronson, collaborating with \nLet’s Dance producer Nile Rodgers, and even \ncovering inspiration Scott Walker’s “Nite Flights.” On \ntop of that, the record was inspired by his recent \nmarriage to supermodel Iman — the record is \nbookended with “The Wedding” and “The Wedding \nSong” — and then tied up and presented as a \nsophisticated modern urban soul record, one that \ndraws from uptown soul (including, rather bafflingly, \na duet with Al B. Sure!) and state-of-the-art dance-\nclub techno, while adding splashy touches like solos \nfrom avant jazz trumpeter Lester Bowie and a nod to \nmodern alt-rock via a nifty cover of Morrissey’s “I \nKnow It’s Gonna Happen Someday.” That’s a lot of \nstuff for one record to handle, so it shouldn’t come \nas a great surprise that the album doesn’t always \nwork, but its stylish restlessness comes as a great \nrelief, particularly when compared to the hermetically \nsealed previous solo Bowie record, 1987’s Never Let \nMe Down. Black Tie White Noise displays greater \nmusical ambition than any record he’d made since \nScary Monsters, and while much of the record feels \nlike unrealized ideas, there are songs where it all \ngels, like on the paranoid jumble of “Jump They \nSay,” the aforementioned covers, the impassioned \n“You’ve Been Around,” and the self-consciously \nsmooth title track. Moments like these are the first in \na long time to feel classically Bowie, and they point \nahead toward the more interesting records he made \nin the second half of the ‘90s, but they are encased \nin a production that not only sounds dated years \nlater, but sounded dated upon its release in the \nspring of 1993, two years into the thick of alternative \nrock. At that point, the club-centric, mainstream-\ncourting Black Tie White Noise seemed as an \nanachronism during the guitar-heavy grunge-n-\nindustrial glory days — something Bowie tacitly \nacknowledged with its 1995 successor, Outside, \nwhich was every bit as gloomy as a Nine Inch Nails \nrecord — but separated from the vagaries of fashion, \nit’s an interesting first step in Bowie’s creative revival.");

A Non-Linear Gothic Drama Hyper-Cycle.” \nAlright, so it reeks of pretension. One belabors the \npoint because Bowie at his best has always been \npretentious, risque, creatively (if sometimes \ncontrivedly) over the top. 1. Outside marks the first in \na planned series of collaborations with multi-\ninstrumentalist, producer, and conceptualist Brian \nEno based on a Bowie short story. In this end-of-\nmillennium setting, “art-crimes” and “concept \nmuggings” merit their own police division funded by \nthe “Arts Protectorate of London.” Echoes of the \nBerlin “outsider” Bowie/Eno ‘70s trilogy of Low, \nHeroes, and Lodger reverberate throughout, \nincluding a return to the “cut-and-paste” lyric-\nassembly method then employed, only this time fed \nthrough a Mac rather than more labor-intensive \npaper-and-scissors tools. The thusly fragmented \n“narrative” follows the investigations of Detective \nProfessor Adler into the murder and subsequent \ndismembered body parts exhibition of 14-year-old \nrunaway Baby Grace Blue. In this cut-up, composite \nworld, each character, including Adler, Baby Grace, \nmixed-race youth Leon Blank, septuagenarian \nAlgeria Touchshriek, and art-terrorist Ramona A. \nStone, reflects a different aspect of Bowie himself \nand is therefore a component of all the previous \npersonas Bowie has enacted over the years. The \nmusic also randomly dices and displays many of the \nprevious album settings such personas have \npopulated. To complete the cube, Bowie then draws \non musicians that form a kind of anagram band from \nhis past. The closest “Ziggy” link comes courtesy of \npianist Mike Garson, whose icy, tinkling jazz runs \nevoke many a spine-tingly moment from Aladdin \nSane and Diamond Dogs. Besides Garson and Eno, \nother names familiar to those who follow the Bowie \ncanon include guitarists Carlos Alomar (Station to \nStation through Scary Monsters) and Reeves \nGrabels (Tin Machine), and ‘90s collaborators such \nas drummer Sterling Campbell (Black Tie White \nNoise) and multi-instrumentalist Erdal Kizilcay \n(Buddha). Diamond Dogs, inspired by George \nOrwell’s 1984, is another obvious precursor to 1. \nOutside’s dissection of a post-apocalyptic, \ntechnological society in the name of Art. Bowie \ninflicts “in-character” spoken word segments as \nbetween-song segues, several of which evoke the \nCockney campiness of such ‘60s period pieces as \n“Please Mr. Gravedigger” and “The Laughing \nGnome” — humor (intentional or not) that softens an \notherwise bleak landscape. So, should you actually \ncare about this dense, dark, difficult story and its \ngenerally unsympathetic characters? The effort \nrequired to adequately “process” 1. Outside pays off \nin a richly voyeuristic experience where Bowie once \nagain reflects fringe culture onto the mainstream and \nforces us to consider that the differences are not so great.");

Not only that, but it feels \nunlike anything else in his catalog. Bowie’s music \nhas always been a product of artifice, intelligence, \nand synthesis. Hours is a relaxed, natural departure \nfrom this method. Arriving after two labored albums, \nthe shift in tone is quite refreshing. “Thursday’s \nChild,” the album’s engaging mid-tempo opener, is \na good indication of what lays ahead. It feels like \nclassic Bowie, yet recalls no specific era of his \ncareer. For the first time, Bowie has absorbed all the \ndisparate strands of his music, from Hunky Dory \nthrough Earthling. That doesn’t mean Hours is on \npar with his earlier masterworks; it never attempts \nto be that bold. What it does mean is that it’s the \nfirst album where he has accepted his past and is \nwilling to use it as a foundation for new music. \nThat’s the reason why Hours feels open, even \norganic — he’s no longer self-conscious, either \nabout living up to his past or creating a new future. \nIt’s a welcome change, and it produces some fine \nmusic, particularly on the first half of the record, \nwhich is filled with such subdued, subtly winning \nsongs as “Something in the Air,” “Survive,” and \n“Seven.” Toward the end of the album, Bowie \nbranches into harder material, which isn’t quite as \nsuccessful as the first half of the album, yet shares \na similar sensibility. And that’s what’s appealing \nabout Hours — it may not be one of Bowie’s \nclassics, but it’s the work of a masterful musician \nwho has begun to enjoy his craft again and isn’t \nafraid to let things develop naturally.");

Like Hours, this finds Bowie sifting through \nthe sounds of his past, completely at ease with his \nlegacy, crafting a colorful, satisfying album that feels \nlike a classic Bowie album. That’s not to say that \nHeathen recalls any particular album or any era in \nspecific, yet there’s a deliberate attempt to recapture \nthe atmosphere, the tone of his ‘70s work — there’s \na reason that Bowie decided to reteam with Tony \nVisconti, the co-producer of some of his best \nrecords, for this album — even if direct comparisons \nare hard to come by. Which is exactly what’s so \nimpressive about this album. Bowie and Visconti \nnever shy away from electronic instrumentations or \nmodern production — if anything, they embrace it — \nbut it’s woven into Bowie’s sound subtly, never \ndrawing attention to the drum loops, guitar synths, \nand washes of electronica. For that matter, guest \nspots by Dave Grohl and Pete Townshend (both on \nguitar) don’t stand out either; they’re merely added \ntexture to this an album that’s intricately layered, but \nalways plays smoothly and alluringly. And, make no \nmistake, this is an alluring, welcoming, friendly \nalbum — there are some moody moments, but \nBowie takes Neil Young’s eerie “I’ve Been Waiting for \nYou” and Pixies’ elusively brutal, creepy “Cactus” \nand turns them sweet, which isn’t necessarily a bad \nthing, either. In the end, that’s the key to Heathen — \nthe undercurrent of happiness, not in the lyrics, but \nin the making of music, a realization by Bowie and \nVisconti alike that they are perfect collaborators. \nUnlike their previous albums together, this doesn’t \nboldly break new ground, but that’s because, 22 \nyears after their last collaboration, Scary Monsters, \nboth Bowie and Visconti don’t need to try as hard, \nso they just focus on the craft.

Working once again with \nproducer Tony Visconti, Bowie again returns to a \nsound from the past, yet tweaks it enough to make it \nseem modern, not retro. Last time around, he \nconcentrated on his early-‘70s sound, creating an \namalgam of Hunky Dory through Heroes. With \nReality, he picks up where he left off, choosing to \nrevise the sound of Heroes through Scary Monsters, \nwith the latter functioning as a sonic blueprint for the \nalbum. Basically, Reality is a well-adjusted Scary \nMonsters, minus the paranoia and despair — and if \nthose two ingredients were key to the feeling and \neffect of that album, it’s a credit to Bowie that he’s \nfound a way to retain the sound and approach of \nthat record, but turn it bright and cheerful and keep it \ninteresting. Since part of the appeal of Monsters is \nthe creeping sense of unease and its icy \ndetachment, it would seem that a warmer, mature \nvariation on that would not be successful, but Bowie \nand Visconti are sharp record-makers, retaining what \nworks — layers of voices and guitars, sleek \nkeyboards, coolly propulsive rhythms — and tying \nthem to another strong set of songs. Like Heathen, \nthe songs deliberately recall classic Bowie by being \nboth tuneful and adventurous, both hallmarks of his \n‘70s work. If this isn’t as indelible as anything he cut \nduring that decade, that’s merely the fate of mature \nwork by veteran rockers. So, Reality doesn’t have \nthe shock of the new, but it does offer some \nsurprises, chief among them the inventive, assured \nproduction and memorable songs. It’s a little artier \nthan Heathen, but similar in its feel and just as \nsatisfying. Both records are testaments to the fact \nthat veteran rockers can make satisfyingly classicist \nrecords without resulting in nostalgia or getting too \ncomfortable.

Reasons for Bowie’s absence were many \nand few, perhaps related to a health scare in 2004, \nperhaps due to a creative dry spell, perhaps he \nsimply didn’t have songs to sing, or perhaps he had \na lingering suspicion that by the time the new \nmillennium was getting into full swing he was \nstarting to be taken for granted. He had settled into a \nproductive purple patch in the late ‘90s, a \ndevelopment that was roundly ignored by all except \nthe devoted and the press, who didn’t just give \nHours, Heathen, and Reality a pass, they recognized \nthem as a strong third act in a storied career. That \nsame sentiment applies to The Next Day, an album \nrecorded with largely the same team as Reality — \nthe same musicians and the same producer, his l\nongtime lieutenant Tony Visconti — and, \nappropriately, shares much of the same moody, \nmeditative sound as its predecessor Heathen. \nWhat’s different is the reception, which is \nappropriately breathless because Bowie has been \ngone so long we all know what we’ve missed. And \nThe Next Day is designed to remind us all of why \nwe’ve missed him, containing hints of the Thin White \nDuke and Ziggy Stardust within what is largely an \nelegant, considered evocation of the Berlin Bowie so \ncalculating it opens with a reworking of “Beauty & \nThe Beast,” and is housed in an artful desecration of \nthe Heroes LP cover. Unlike his Berlin trilogy of the \nlate ‘70s, The Next Day is rarely unsettling. Apart \nfrom the crawling closer “Heat” — a quiet, \nshimmering, hallucination-channeling late-‘70s Scott \nWalker — the album has been systematically \nstripped of eeriness, trading discomfort for pleasure \nat every turn. And pleasure it does deliver, as nobody \nknows how to do classic Bowie like Bowie and \nVisconti, the two life-long collaborators sifting \nthrough their past, picking elements that relate to \nwhat Bowie is now: an elder statesman who made a \nconscious decision to leave innovation behind long \nago. This persistent, well-manicured nostalgia could \naccount for the startling warmth that exudes from \nThe Next Day; even when a melody sighs with an air \nof resigned melancholia, as it does on “Where Are \nWe Now?,” it never delves into sadness, it stays \nafloat in a warm, soothing bath. That overwhelming \nfamiliarity is naturally quite appealing for anyone \nwell-versed in Bowie lore, but The Next Day isn’t a \ncareer capper; it lacks the ambition to be anything \nso grand. The Next Day neither enhances nor \ndiminishes anything that came before, it’s merely a \nsweet coda to a towering career.");

Arriving after a ten-year \ndrought, The Next Day pulsated with the shock of \nthe new — as Bowie’s first album of new material in \na decade, how could it not? — but ultimately it was \ngrounded in history, something its cover made plain \nin its remix of Heroes artwork. Blackstar occasionally \nrecalls parts of Bowie’s past — two of its key songs, \n“Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)” and “’Tis a Pity She \nWas a Whore,” were even aired in 2014 as a \nsupporting single for the Nothing Has Changed \ncompilation (both are revamped for this album) — \nbut Bowie and producer Tony Visconti are \nunconcerned with weaving winking postmodern \ntapestries; now that they’ve shaken free their \ncreative cobwebs, they’re ready to explore. Certainly, \nthe luxurious ten-minute sprawl of “Blackstar” — a \ntwo-part suite stitched together by string feints and \nominous saxophone — suggests Bowie isn’t \nencumbered with commercial aspirations, but \nBlackstar neither alienates nor does it wander into \nuncharted territory. For all its odd twists, the album \nproceeds logically, unfolding with stately purpose \nand sustaining a dark, glassy shimmer. It is music for \nthe dead of night but not moments of desolation; it’s \ncreated for the moment when today is over but \ntomorrow has yet to begin. Fittingly, the music itself \nis suspended in time, sometimes recalling the hard \nurban gloss of ‘70s prog — Bowie’s work, yes, but \nalso Roxy Music and, especially, the Scott Walker of \nNite Flights — and sometimes evoking the \ndrum’n’bass dabbling of the ‘90s incarnation of the \nThin White Duke, sounds that can still suggest a \ncoming future, but in the context of this album these \nflourishes are the foundation of a persistent present. \nThis comfort with the now is the most striking thing \nabout Blackstar: it is the sound of a restless artist \nfeeling utterly at ease not only within his own skin \nbut within his own time. To that end, Bowie recruited \nsaxophonist Donny McCaslin and several of his New \nYork cohorts to provide the instrumentation (and \ndrafted disciple James Murphy to contribute \npercussion on a pair of cuts), a cast that suggests \nBlackstar goes a bit farther out than it actually does.\n Cannily front-loaded with its complicated cuts \n(songs that were not coincidentally also released as \nteaser singles), Blackstar starts at the fringe and \nworks its way back toward familiar ground, ending \nwith a trio of pop songs dressed in fancy electronics. \nThese don’t erase the heaviness of the opening \nquartet but such a sequencing suggests Blackstar is \ndifficult when the main pleasure of the record is how \nutterly at ease it all feels: Bowie’s joy in emphasizing \nthe art in art-pop is palpable and its elegant, \nunhurried march resonates deeply");
